## TV Licence Fine Demo code
Basic example without any front end styling. A style.css exists ready to be populated with styles.

Example code to demonstrate:
1. A functioning API
2. A MVC pattern using Thymeleaf templates
3. Updating a database record in either a MySQL or an Azure SQL database

A search form - looks up records by reference
The search result populates another form with the amount due and the reference (the idea here is payment/credit card details etc could be added here too)
The balance of the fine is reduced by the amount entered in this form
